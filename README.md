# Mission-to-Mars

This module was challenging and although my results were not as I had wished for, I did learn a lot from this exercise, making the executive decision to submit as-is and move forward with the additional learnings. This is my first time with any programming language and dipping into HTML, Mongo and BeautifulSoup was a good expereince. 

I look forward to working in an environment that will bolster oppoortunities to go deeper on a consistent level and perhaps that will be with HTML, perhaps not. I will take this experience with me. 

Thank you!
